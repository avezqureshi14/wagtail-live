# How to write a websocket publisher

This guide shows how to write a publisher following the websocket protocol.

There are three ways to add a websocket publisher to Wagtail Live:

1. The classical way to add websocket support to a Django project which is using [Django channels](https://channels.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).
    
    Wagtail live already ships with a `DjangoChannelsPublisher`.

2. Use a hosted websocket solution.
    
    Examples: [Pusher](https://pusher.com/), [PieSocket](https://www.piesocket.com/), [Ably](https://ably.com/).

3. Deploy a separate server based on a framework or library that supports websocket.

    Examples: [Starlette](https://github.com/encode/starlette), [Websockets](https://github.com/aaugustin/websockets), [Tornado](https://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/).

In this guide we will see how to add a websocket publisher using either a hosted third-party solution or by deploying a separate server. Here are the steps to follow for both methods:

1. Inherit from [`BaseWebsocketPublisher`](https://wagtail.github.io/wagtail-live/reference/publishers/base_websocket_publisher/) and implement the `publish` method. This method handles publishing updates to websocket clients.

2. Add client side logic.


## Implement `publish` method

### Hosted websocket solutions

We have to check the third-party service's documentation to implement the `publish` method for hosted websocket solutions.

The relevant sections for Pusher, PieSocket and Ably can be found below:

- [Pusher - Publishing events](https://pusher.com/docs/channels/server_api/http-api/#publishing-events)
- [PieSocket - Publish with Python](https://www.piesocket.com/docs/3.0/python)
- [Ably - Sending a message](https://ably.com/documentation/quick-start-guide#sending-messages)

Wagtail Live provides a `PieSocketPublisher` which `publish` method is implemented as follows:

```python
# generic imports here

from wagtail_live.publishers.websocket import BaseWebsocketPublisher

from .utils import get_piesocket_api_key, get_piesocket_secret

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

publish_url = "https://www.piesocket.com/api/publish"
headers = {"Content-Type": "application/json"}

class PieSocketPublisher(BaseWebsocketPublisher):
    def publish(self, channel_id, renders, removals):
        payload = json.dumps(
            {
                "key": get_piesocket_api_key(),
                "secret": get_piesocket_secret(),
                "channelId": channel_id,
                "message": {"renders": renders, "removals": removals},
            }
        )

        # Publish update to PieSocket server
        response = requests.post(publish_url, headers=headers, data=payload)

        # Check for errors
        if not response.ok:
            logger.error("Failed publishing new update to PieSocket API.")
```

### Deploy a separate server

The design proposed here is heavily inspired from [this awesome guide](https://websockets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/howto/django.html) from the `websockets` library docs. Here is an extract explaining the idea:

> We need a event bus to enable communications between Django and websockets. Both sides connect permanently to the bus. Then Django writes events and websockets reads them. For the sake of simplicity, weâ€™ll rely on Redis Pub/Sub.

Wagtail Live provides a `RedisPubSubPublisher` which implements the `publish` method.

If we want to use Redis Pub/Sub as en event bus, we can subclass the previous class as follows:

```python
from wagtail_live.publishers.redis import RedisPubSubPublisher

class MyWebsocketPublisher(RedisPubSubPublisher):
    pass
```

You can also provide your own event bus and implement the `publish` method accordingly.

In this architecture, we need to perform additional work to handle websocket connections.

#### Handle websocket connections

Let's create an `app.py` file inside the publisher module where we define the `app`.

At a lower level, the `app` is an async callable or an ASGI app that handles websocket connections in these steps:

1. Accept a websocket connection and add it to the event bus.
2. Send message to a websocket connection when a live page update is available.
2. Wait for a websocket connection to be closed and remove it from the event bus.

If our publisher inherits from `RedisPubSubPublisher`, we need to take these additional steps:

1. Define the `broadcast` coroutine and instantiate a `RedisBus`.
    
    The purpose of this coroutine is to send a message to a group of websocket connections:
    ```python
    import asyncio

    async def broadcast(message, recipients):
        """Broadcasts `message` to `recipients`."""

        await asyncio.wait([ws.send_method(message) for ws in recipients])
    ```
    In a real implementation, the `send_method` corresponds to the 'send' method of a websocket connection object in the library/framework used.

    For example, with `websockets` the `send_method` is `send` and with `starlette` it's `send_json`, `send_text` or `send_bytes`.

    With the `broadcast` method defined, we can now instantiate an event bus:
    ```python
    from wagtail_live.publishers.redis import RedisBus
    from wagtail_live.publishers.utils import get_redis_url

    bus = RedisBus(url=get_redis_url(), broadcast=broadcast)
    ```

2. Run the bus on startup.

    Finally, we'll need to 'run' the bus when the `app` starts running.

    This will depend on how the framework/library used handles running tasks on startup.

    For example, with `websockets` we can use the `serve` context manager and run the bus as long the the server is running:
    ```python
    import websockets

    async with websockets.serve(handler, host, port):
        await bus.run()  # Run the event bus forever
    ```

    > Starlette applications can register multiple event handlers for dealing with code that needs to run before the application starts up, or when the application is shutting down.

    ```python
    from starlette.applications import Starlette

    app = Starlette()

    @app.on_event("startup")
    def startup():
        # Run the event bus on startup
        asyncio.create_task(bus.run())
    ```

You can see [`StarlettePublisherApp`](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail-live/blob/main/src/wagtail_live/publishers/starlette/app.py), [`WebsocketsPublisherApp`](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail-live/blob/main/src/wagtail_live/publishers/websockets/app.py) and [`DjangoChannelsApp](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail-live/blob/main/src/wagtail_live/publishers/django_channels/app.py) for complete implementations of the `app`.

#### Setup Django before running the `app`

Since we're using Django in a [standalone script](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/topics/settings/#calling-django-setup-is-required-for-standalone-django-usage), we need to call `django.setup()` before running the `app`:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    import django
    django.setup()

    # Run the app here
```

## Client side logic
